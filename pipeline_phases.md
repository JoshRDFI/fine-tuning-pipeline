\## Instructions



\- At the end of each phase, verify the completion check before proceeding.

\- If any ambiguity or error is encountered, log the issue and mark the affected section as "UNCERTAIN" in the output.

\- Use clear, explicit, and unambiguous language throughout.

\- All scripts and tests should be placed in the appropriate directories as specified in the project structure.
